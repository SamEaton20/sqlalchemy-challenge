# sqlalchemy-challenge
I got help from a classmate, Yara El-Emam, and ChatGPT.
#Reflect Tables into SQLAlchemy ORM
Created the engine
Declared a base using automap_base
Printed the classes mapped to the Base
Assigned the variables of each class
Created a session
#Exploratory Precipitation Analysis
Found the most recent date
Got the last 12 months after the most recednt date 
Created a table for Precipitation Data
Used Pandas to get the summary statistics
#Exploratory Station Analysis
Got the number of stations
Got a query for the activity of the station and put them in descending order of activity
Got the most active station and the calculated lowest, highest, and average temps
Closed the session

Made the app by importing the dependencies, getting the database setup, then the Flask setup, then the routes.
